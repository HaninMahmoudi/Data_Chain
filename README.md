# üåê **Web3 Data Exchange Platform**

Welcome to our decentralized data exchange platform! üöÄ

# Project concept description

As we all know, one of the main goals of the transition to web3 and the blockchain technology is to
guarantee the decentralization and the removal of the third parties that own and manipulate the data.

However we noticed a major problem due to the huge request for data in order to develop AI Products,
whether by huge companies, startups, or individuals.

So we came up with a solution, a decentralized platform that runs on a blockchain network, for
companies to share requests for data, and individuals to fill the data requests and get paid for it while
maintaining their privacy and anonymity.

Each data request, made by a company, must follows a set of rules of privacy and do not ask for
personal informations that are related to a person‚Äôs identity.

We will guarentee a high level of integrity of the data submissions by avoiding that one person fills a
request multiple times using fake generated data and multiple public keys.

The solution is delivered as a DApp (Decentralized Application) that is user-friendly to ease the data
contribution process for normal users, and provides a seperate interface for companies to submit their
data collection requests.
# KYC Integration in Future Versions

## Overview

In our ongoing commitment to enhancing user experience and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, we have introduced Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the latest version of our application. Additionally, this document outlines our vision for future releases, including the integration of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for even more secure and private user verification.

## Current KYC Integration

### Enhanced User Verification

The latest version of our app includes a robust KYC system to strengthen user verification processes. This involves the collection of necessary identity information while respecting user privacy.

### Streamlined Onboarding

Our current KYC integration aims to offer a streamlined onboarding process, providing a secure and efficient way for users to access advanced features within the app.

## Future DIDs Integration

### Secure and Decentralized Identity

In future versions, we plan to implement Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to further enhance user identity verification. DIDs offer a decentralized and secure way for users to control their identity, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

### User-Centric Approach

The integration of DIDs aligns with our user-centric approach, allowing users to have greater control over their identity information. We believe in empowering users to manage their digital identity securely.

## User Privacy and Data Security

### Privacy-Centric KYC

As we integrate KYC processes, we remain committed to a privacy-centric approach. Users will continue to have control over the information they share, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.

### Secure Storage and Blockchain Integration

KYC information is securely stored, and blockchain technology is leveraged to enhance data security. This ensures protection against unauthorized access and maintains the integrity of user data.

## Staying Informed

### Release Notes and Announcements

Stay informed about upcoming features, including the KYC integration, by regularly checking our release notes and announcements. We will provide detailed information on the new functionalities and improvements in each release.
