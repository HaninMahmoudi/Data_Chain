# KYC Integration in Future Versions

## Overview

In anticipation of future releases, we are planning to integrate a Know Your Customer (KYC) system into our application. While the current version of the app doesn't include KYC processes, this document outlines our intentions and provides insight into how KYC will be implemented in subsequent versions.

## Upcoming KYC Integration

### Enhanced User Verification

In our next releases, we aim to implement a comprehensive KYC system to enhance user verification and compliance. This will involve the collection of necessary identity information while respecting user privacy.

### Streamlined Onboarding

The KYC integration will be designed to offer a streamlined onboarding process for our users, ensuring a secure and efficient way to access advanced features within the app.

## User Privacy and Data Security

### Privacy-Centric Approach

Our commitment to user privacy remains a top priority. As we integrate KYC processes, we will adhere to a privacy-centric approach, giving users control over the information they share.

### Secure Storage

KYC information will be securely stored, and we will leverage blockchain technology to enhance data security, ensuring that user data is protected against unauthorized access.




## Conclusion

We are excited about the upcoming KYC integration and are committed to creating an app that not only meets regulatory requirements but also prioritizes user privacy and security.
